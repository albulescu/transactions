# Transactions Microservice

Besides authentication you get transactions endpoints for working with transactions. Rest api is provided by express.js, and it runs on the port you specify like `env PORT=80`.

For each transaction endpoint you must provide `Authorization` header containing the access token from sign in endpoint.

## Installation
